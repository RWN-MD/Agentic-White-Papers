# Agentic White Papers

## Introduction
The **Agentic White Papers** repository is a core resource within the [Agentic Network](https://github.com/RWN-MD/Agentic-Network) project. It houses the foundational documentation and research that define the vision, purpose, and technical implementation of the `.agent` top-level domain (TLD). This repository is a vital part of our journey to establish `.agent` as the future of agentic communication.

## Purpose
This repository provides a centralized location for:
- **Conceptual White Papers:** Detailed explanations of the `.agent` ecosystem, its goals, and its potential impact on AI, IoT, and beyond.
- **Technical Documentation:** In-depth technical research and references supporting the `.agent` infrastructure.
- **ICANN Proposal Drafts:** Application materials and drafts for the ICANN New gTLD Program to secure `.agent` as a recognized TLD.

## Contents
1. **White Papers (`/whitepapers`):**  
   - Documents outlining the concept, vision, and practical applications of `.agent`.  
   - Includes both high-level and technical explorations of the TLD's value to AI and IoT ecosystems.

2. **ICANN Proposal (`/ICANN-proposal`):**  
   - Drafts of application materials required to secure `.agent` during the ICANN New gTLD Program.  
   - Includes compliance information, use cases, and financial justifications.

3. **Research and References (`/docs`):**  
   - General research materials, citations, and references that support the `.agent` initiative.

## Structure
- **`/whitepapers`**: Conceptual and technical documents about `.agent`.
- **`/ICANN-proposal`**: Materials related to ICANN application and compliance.
- **`/docs`**: Supporting research, citations, and external references.

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are critical to refining the `.agent` vision and ensuring the success of our ICANN application. Areas for contribution include:
- Proposing new concepts or use cases for the `.agent` TLD.
- Reviewing and editing drafts of white papers and ICANN application materials.
- Providing additional research or references to strengthen documentation.

To contribute, please refer to the [Agentic Network](https://github.com/RWN-MD/Agentic-Network) repository for project-wide contribution guidelines.

## How This Repository Fits Into the Agentic Network
The **Agentic White Papers** repository serves as the intellectual foundation for the entire **Agentic Network** project. By documenting our goals, use cases, and technical implementations, we aim to:
- Establish credibility with stakeholders, including ICANN, investors, and the broader AI community.
- Build a comprehensive knowledge base to guide the development of the `.agent` ecosystem.
